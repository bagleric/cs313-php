                    <h1>Eric Bagley</h1>
                    <p>My name as you now know is Eric Bagley. I was born and raised on a small ranch and dairy farm in victor Idaho. Thats why my wife calls me her farmboy. Despite growing up on a farm I have always been interested in computers. That interest did not lead me to coding until just a few years ago. apart from that, I love both listening and playing music, being in the outdoors, and spending time with family.</p>

                <div id="descriptionFamily">
                    <p>I met my wife in spring of 2016 in the Math Lab at BYU-Idaho. We were both working there as tutors. I guess you could say that things just added up. We decided to build our friendship that turned into a lifelong relationship. We were married January 2017 in the Salt lake temple. She is a music major and plays the violin. Currently, we are finishing up school. I will graduate in December of 2017 and Amira, my wife, will graduate winter semester of 2018.</p>

                <div id="descriptionFuture">
                    <p>Our plans as of right now are undecided. We are still analyzing our options. We do hop to have a large family, live long and healthy lives, and eventually serve missions for the Church. </p>
